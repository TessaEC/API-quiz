# API Code Quiz

## Description
This code quiz allows users to test their skills by completing a timed quiz and storing their scores on a Leaderboard for others to also play and see how everyone is ranked. The quiz has been created using javascript, HTML and CSS. Some methods used within the javascript include traversing the DOM and the use of storing information in the windows localstorage.

## Visuals

The quiz' home page consists of a sleek yet bright look where users receive the game rules, a start button to enter the quiz portion and a leaderboard link in the top left hand corner. This way users can view the leaderboard at any point.

Once the quiz starts, the users will see a countdown timer in clear view. They will then answer 5 multiple choice questions. If they answer one wrong, 10 seconds is deducted from their time/score.

When the clock hits zero or they have finished all of their questions they will reach the end page. Here users will be able to view their score, click a "Play Again" link that will take them back to the start page, input their first name, and submit their score to be saved on a ranked leaderboard.
